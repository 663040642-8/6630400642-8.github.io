                <h3>Study with Angular</h3>
                <p>
                    Angular is a powerful framework developed by Google for building dynamic and modern web
                    applications. It uses TypeScript, which adds strong typing and object-oriented features to
                    JavaScript. One of the biggest advantages of Angular is its modular architecture and powerful tools
                    like Angular CLI, which simplifies development tasks such as scaffolding components and services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While studying Angular, I learned how to create reusable components, set up routing between views,
                    and connect to APIs using HTTPClient. The learning curve was a bit steep at first, especially with
                    concepts like dependency injection and reactive forms. However, with practice and some hands-on
                    projects, it became much clearer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, learning Angular has given me a solid foundation in front-end engineering and helped me
                    appreciate the value of structured code and maintainability in large-scale applications.
